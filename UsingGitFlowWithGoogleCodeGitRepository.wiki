= Introduction =

The purpose of this article is for me to condense all the information I found online about git, gitflow and Google code that I found useful to me. Your mileage may vary.

= Project Purpose = 
After setting up the Google Code project I decided to create a git repo just for this project I'm endeavoring on. I want to take 2 "hello world!" programs written in php and python from creation to "deployment" through a yet to be defined process that will include branching and tagging using the git-glow workflow model and then code reviewing using Gerrit with automated testing and feedback provided by Jenkins. Why do this crazy thing? Well I want to document the process for two main reasons, one so that I can repeat it and two so that I can improve it as time goes on. Advanced warning. As these articles develop they will be very rough and disorganized. Improvements follow article usefulness. Oh yeah, you asked why I'm using a wiki to do this. Well, I like wiki's and I want to be able to make this content into data that can be moderately transportable. I've moved wiki's form spot a to spot b in the past and the sun rose the next day and the earth was still spinning after all was said and done, so I thought I'd be ok doing it for this body of content.
