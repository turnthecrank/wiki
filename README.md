# Turn The Crank

Life is filled with far too much crank turning. Pointless tasks waste time and create nothing but misery. Repetitive tasks might have a point but are often done more efficiently and accurately if only we had a machine to turn the crank for us. Worse still is the knowledge of experiential learning, lost to the world and even those who lived it.

Our goal is to minimize this pain and suffering. We expect it will help us and hope it will help you as well. If you do software, systems, automation, and documentation of the above you might find our work useful.
